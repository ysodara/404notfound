1: A refined list of primary needs and features. I'll give you some to start with.

2: A refined list of requirements, including any non-functional requirements. Again, just the top-level, most important ones, or the ones that go with your most important needs/features.

3: Identify Epics and Features and break them down into user stories. Then refine/write at least 10 user stories for your main features. Use this format.

As a type of user, I want some goal so that some reason.

4: Modeling outputs. I would like to see some informal Use Case diagrams for your top features, sequence or flow diagrams and a preliminary database design or ER diagram. Identify Entities and Actions. Please do these on a whiteboard (preferred) or hand drawn on paper -- so you can erase and redraw many times. Afterwards, take a photo or scan to put in your repository.

5: Architecture drawing. What hardware/software/network is going to be required to make this work?

6: Refine the given rough Vision discussion into a solid Vision Statement 1.0 using the format we saw in the video (in the Software Engineering slides from last term).

7: Remember that you don't just go through all these in a linear fashion and check off what's done. Use a cyclical approach where you use the tool that will help you accomplish what you're trying to accomplish: figure out the requirements and potential solution space of the project.
