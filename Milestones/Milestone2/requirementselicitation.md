## Initial Requirements Elaboration and Elicitation

### Interviews

Interview:

Team: Hi, we wanted to clarify some things in terms or requirements and needs for this new product.
Customer: Great, how can we help?
T: First off, when visitors come to your site, should they be required to create an account in order to view statistics and other information.
C: No, visitors should be able to freely access meet, race, and athlete information. A visitor would only need an account if they wanted access to analytical data like plots, predictive functionality, etc.
T: Great. We'll specify that. In your system, can athletes be a part of multiple teams?
C: Yes, we have many swimmers that swim for both their school and a club team, or go to college or transfer schools. We want all of their information to be available to them indefinitely, regardless of what team the results are from.
T: Awesome, we will work that into our database design.
C: We were also thinking about potentially adding a way for athletes to share their results to social media. COuld we work in a share button to the webpage and send tweets or make posts about meets with our hashtag and a link to the site?
T: That is something that we would be able to do, how high of a priority is this requirement?
C: This is fairly low priority. I would like to focus on having a clean, modern-looking webpage that has all the display and analyitical capabilities we want first. And then we can dive into social media.
T: We will make note of that. Speaking of the webpage design, did you have a color scheme in mind?
C: No, but since this site will be hosting several teams, we would like to keep the colors as neutral as possible. Possibly greyscale, black, and white. Very clean lines, very modern looking.
T: Great, we will include those specifications in our requirements. Also, how will new data be uploaded? Is it sufficient to provide a template spreadsheet for administrators to fill out and upload to the site?
C: That would be great, if you provide a template, we can easily fill out the information from meets in that format.
T: Wonderful. One last thing: When you look at an individual athlete's results as a visitor, how would you like their athlete page to be displayed?
C: We would like to see a profile page that shows the athletes biographical information, all of hteir race results in chronological order, and a list of their PR's for each event that they have competed in.
T: Great. I think that clears up the questions that we had, thank you!
C: No problem.
