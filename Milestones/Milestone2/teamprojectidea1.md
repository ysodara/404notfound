## Team Project Idea ##

Idea: A website for coaches to add workouts for their athletes, keep track of records, lifts, PR's, and can predict what their future PR's could be. 

1. What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
* This project allows coaches to add workouts, lifts, and other such athletic trainings. It also allows coaches to save their stats. It can predict what their lift weights are (in percents) based on their previous records. Coaches can add or choose workouts based on what goal they want for their athlete. Coaches can also print off the workouts for a specific athlete so they have a personalized training schedule. A related website is Wodify.com, which tracks workouts, lifts, and gymnastic elements for CrossFitters. Although Wodify does most of these features, it does not allow for personalized training workouts. It also does not allow for Coaches to choose specific workouts per athlete. 
2. Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
* It is functional for any sort of athletic program, especially for off-season athletes. It's versitile for many different workout assosiations, like CrossFit, Collegete Programs, High School Programs, or Clubs. WhiteBoard features will show what athletes have done the workout of that day and their time/weight. It will rank them from best to worst.  
3. What are a few major features?
* [Tracks Lifts and Calculates Future Lifts] Based upon what their past lift records are, an algorithm will give them a chart of percentages to show what weight they should be lifting based on what percent of effort they are suppose to give. (Ex: If their 1 rep max PR is 100lbs, then the website will say that their 50% effort weight is 50lbs.) 
* [FitBit API] Using a FitBit, it can track heart rate, time for workouts, sleep, food logging, friends, body adn weight, activity, daily summary data, daily goals, distance, calorie burn, minutes sedentary, floors, steps, and much more. We can then use that data to build the algorithm for that athletes for future workouts. 
4. What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
* Fitbit API
* Azure
* BootStrap
5. What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
* The algorithm will take their stats from the FitBit and their lift records, and they will output a workout with the correct weights and goal time/reps for that specific person. 
6. Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.
* 8 - Based on the API and the algorithm, we believe that this project could easily get more complex as time goes on.
