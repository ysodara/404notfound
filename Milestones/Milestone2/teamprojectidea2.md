## Project Idea 2 ##

Idea: Tinder for Musicians
A site for musicians to share song ideas they're working on, collaborate and find other musicians to jam with, form a band, and discover new music based on what they're already listening to.

1. What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
* This site would make music recording and sharing quick and seamless to allow users to quickly record an idea and share it for other people to listen to and add their own ideas on top of. Some of these features have been implemented in mobile app form but a web application would be much more broad in scope.
* The music discovery aspect has been implemented before by sites like Pandora, Spotify, and Last.fm but this project would focus on new, unpopular artists and help them gain exposure to fellow musicians based on their genre and style of music.

2. Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
* As a musician this would be a powerful tool for finding other musicians in the area to form a band or just jam with, gain exposure, and discover new music.
* Our algorithm will be fine-tuned using api's to collect information about music users are listening to on other platforms, and suggesting them music that exists on our platform based on that history. Suggestions would be ranked by popularity based on how many people are listening to a specific artist.

3. What are a few major features?
* Audio recording and streaming (possibly linked to an existing api like Soundcloud or a filesharing site)
* The ability to record on top of someone else's post and share that as a comment
* Social messaging between users to comment and arrange music events
* Music suggestions based on a user's activity on other sites (Spotify, Pandora api's)
* Tracking how many views a song gets to rank it in search results

4. What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
* An affordable, quick, and easy to use audio recording and streaming service
* Music streaming api's

5. What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
* Suggesting musical artists based on similar characteristics like genre and style of music
* Sorting of artist suggestions by popularity rank (data collected about how many people are listening to each artist)
 
6. Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.
* 9.5
