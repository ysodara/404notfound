# Welcome!
This is the project repository for 404 Not Found, a team working on the CS461/CS462 2020 Capstone course at Western Oregon University. This project, along with our related class work, fulfills WOU's requirements for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

## Our Project: Peak Performace
This web application will assist sports coaches in creating and assigning workouts to the athletes on their teams on an individualized basis.
>For teams and coaches looking to bring their athletes' strength training performance to the next level, Peak Performance is designed to tailor a variety of workouts to the athlete, keep athletes and coaches on the same page about training, and help athletes and coaches set training goals and make plans to accomplish them. Peak Performance will provide continuous workout programs tailored to an athlete's specific needs and abilities, exercise tracking, and interfacing with social media to allow for a well-rounded strength training experience for all athletes. Unlike many other strength training apps that are bogged down with features and add-ons that are never used, our product strives to serve our customers in the simplest, but most effective ways; helping athletes achieve their goals and helping teams grow closer as they do it.
